Has scope allows you to easily create controller filters based on your resources named scopes.
Imagine the following model called graduations:

```ruby
class Graduation < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :featured, -> { where(:featured => true) }
  scope :by_degree, -> degree { where(:degree => degree) }
  scope :by_period, -> started_at, ended_at { where("started_at = ? AND ended_at = ?", started_at, ended_at) }
end
```

You can use those named scopes as filters by declaring them on your controller:

```ruby
class GraduationsController < ApplicationController
  has_scope :featured, :type => :boolean
  has_scope :by_degree
end
```

Now, if you want to apply them to an specific resource, you just need to call `apply_scopes`:

```ruby
class GraduationsController < ApplicationController
  has_scope :featured, :type => :boolean
  has_scope :by_degree
  has_scope :by_period, :using => [:started_at, :ended_at], :type => :hash

  def index
    @graduations = apply_scopes(Graduation).all
  end
end
```

Then for each request:

```
/graduations
#=> acts like a normal request

/graduations?featured=true
#=> calls the named scope and bring featured graduations

/graduations?by_period[started_at]=20100701&by_period[ended_at]=20101013
#=> brings graduations in the given period

/graduations?featured=true&by_degree=phd
#=> brings featured graduations with phd degree
```

You can retrieve all the scopes applied in one action with `current_scopes` method.
In the last case, it would return: { :featured => true, :by_degree => "phd" }.

## Installation

Add `has_scope` to your Gemfile or install it from Rubygems.

```ruby
gem 'has_scope'
```

## Options

HasScope supports several options:

* `:type` - Checks the type of the parameter sent.
  By default, it does not allow hashes or arrays to be given,
  except if type `:hash` or `:array` are set.
  Symbols are never permitted to prevent memory leaks, so ensure any routing
  constraints you have that add parameters use string values.

* `:only` - In which actions the scope is applied.

* `:except` - In which actions the scope is not applied.

* `:as` - The key in the params hash expected to find the scope. Defaults to the scope name.

* `:using` - The subkeys to be used as args when type is a hash.

* `:if` - Specifies a method, proc or string to call to determine if the scope should apply.

* `:unless` - Specifies a method, proc or string to call to determine if the scope should NOT apply.

* `:default` - Default value for the scope. Whenever supplied the scope is always called.

* `:allow_blank` - Blank values are not sent to scopes by default. Set to true to overwrite.

* `:in` - A shortcut for combining the `:using` option with nested hashes.

## Boolean usage

If `type: :boolean` is set it just calls the named scope, without any arguments, when parameter
is set to a "true" value. `'true'` and `'1'` are parsed as `true`, everything else as `false`.

When boolean scope is set up with `allow_blank: true`, it will call the scope
with the value as usual scope.

```ruby
has_scope :visible, type: :boolean
has_scope :active, type: :boolean, allow_blank: true

# and models with
scope :visible, -> { where(visible: true) }
scope :active, ->(value = true) { where(active: value) }
```

## Block usage

`has_scope` also accepts a block. The controller, current scope and value are yielded
to the block so the user can apply the scope on its own. This is useful in case we
need to manipulate the given value:

```ruby
has_scope :category do |controller, scope, value|
  value != "all" ? scope.by_category(value) : scope
end
```

When used with booleans without `:allow_blank`, it just receives two arguments
and is just invoked if true is given:

```ruby
has_scope :not_voted_by_me, :type => :boolean do |controller, scope|
  scope.not_voted_by(controller.current_user.id)
end
```

## Apply scope on every request

To apply scope on every request set default value and `allow_blank: true`:

```ruby
has_scope :available, default: nil, allow_blank: true, only: :show, unless: :admin?

# model:
scope :available, ->(*) { where(blocked: false) }
```

This will allow usual users to get only available items, but admins will
be able to access blocked items too.
