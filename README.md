## HasScope

Has scope allows you to map incoming controller parameters to named scopes in your resources.
Imagine the following model called graduations:

```ruby
class Graduation < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :featured, -> { where(:featured => true) }
  scope :by_degree, -> degree { where(:degree => degree) }
  scope :by_period, -> started_at, ended_at { where("started_at = ? AND ended_at = ?", started_at, ended_at) }
  scope :high_gpa, -> { where("gpa > 3") }
  scope :low_gpa, -> { where("gpa <= 3") }
end
```

You can use those named scopes as filters by declaring them on your controller:

```ruby
class GraduationsController < ApplicationController
  has_scope :featured, :type => :boolean
  has_scope :by_degree
  has_scope :high_gpa, :scope_by_value :gpa
  has_scope :low_gpa, :scope_by_value :gpa
end
```

Now, if you want to apply them to an specific resource, you just need to call `apply_scopes`:

```ruby
class GraduationsController < ApplicationController
  has_scope :featured, :type => :boolean
  has_scope :by_degree
  has_scope :by_period, :using => [:started_at, :ended_at], :type => :hash
  has_scope :high_gpa, :scope_by_value :gpa
  has_scope :low_gpa, :scope_by_value :gpa

  def index
    @graduations = apply_scopes(Graduation).all
  end
end
```

Then for each request:

```
/graduations
#=> acts like a normal request

/graduations?featured=true
#=> calls the named scope and bring featured graduations

/graduations?by_period[started_at]=20100701&by_period[ended_at]=20101013
#=> brings graduations in the given period

/graduations?gpa=high_gpa&by_degree=phd
#=> brings high GPA phd graduates

/graduations?gpa=low_gpa&by_degree=phd
#=> brings low GPA phd graduates

/graduations?featured=true&by_degree=phd
#=> brings featured graduations with phd degree
```

After `apply_scopes` has been called, you can retrieve all the scopes applied in
one action with `current_scopes` method.

In the last case, it would return: `{ :featured => true, :by_degree => "phd" }`.

## Installation

Add `has_scope` to your Gemfile or install it from Rubygems.

```ruby
gem 'has_scope'
```

## Options

HasScope supports several options:

* `:type` - Checks the type of the parameter sent.
  By default, it does not allow hashes or arrays to be given,
  except if type `:hash` or `:array` are set.
  Symbols are never permitted to prevent memory leaks, so ensure any routing
  constraints you have that add parameters use string values.

* `:only` - In which actions the scope is applied.

* `:except` - In which actions the scope is not applied.

* `:as` - The key in the params hash expected to find the scope. Defaults to the scope name.

* `:using` - The subkeys to be used as args when type is a hash.

* `:if` - Specifies a method, proc or string to call to determine if the scope should apply.

* `:unless` - Specifies a method, proc or string to call to determine if the scope should NOT apply.

* `:default` - Default value for the scope. Whenever supplied the scope is always called.

* `:allow_blank` - Blank values are not sent to scopes by default. Set to true to overwrite.

* `:in` - A shortcut for combining the `:using` option with nested hashes.
          For example, `has_scope xyz, :in => :abc` is the same as
          `has_scope xyz, :as => :abc, :using => :xyz, :type => :hash`, and
          would make the scope apply when the params are "?abc[xyz]=value".

* `:if_value` - For string and numeric types, indicates the value that the param
                must have if the scope should apply.

* `:unless_value` - For string and numeric types, indicates the value that the
                    param must have if the scope should NOT apply.

* `:no_value_passing`  - Does not pass the value of the param to the scope.
                         Often used with :if_value and :unless_value if the
                         value is just used to determine which scope is active.

* `:scope_by_value` - A shortcut for combining `:no_value_passing`, `:as`, and
                      `:if_value`. `:as` is set to the value provided to this
                      option, and `:if_value` is set to the scope name.
                      For example,
                      `has_scope xyz, :scope_by_value => :filter`
                      is equivalent to
                      `has_scope xyz, :as => :filter, :if_value => :xyz, :no_value_passing => true`

## Boolean usage

If `type: :boolean` is set it just calls the named scope, without any arguments, when parameter
is set to a "true" value. `'true'` and `'1'` are parsed as `true`, everything else as `false`.

When boolean scope is set up with `allow_blank: true`, it will call the scope
with the value as usual scope.

```ruby
has_scope :visible, type: :boolean
has_scope :active, type: :boolean, allow_blank: true

# and models with
scope :visible, -> { where(visible: true) }
scope :active, ->(value = true) { where(active: value) }
```

## Block usage

`has_scope` also accepts a block. The controller, current scope and value are yielded
to the block so the user can apply the scope on its own. This is useful in case we
need to manipulate the given value:

```ruby
has_scope :category do |controller, target, value|
  value != "all" ? target.by_category(value) : target
end
```

The `target` argument is the object that was passed to `apply_scopes`, with
prior scopes applied. The block should either apply one or more scopes, or
return the target unmodified.

When used with booleans without `:allow_blank`, it just receives two arguments
and is just invoked if true is given:

```ruby
has_scope :not_voted_by_me, :type => :boolean do |controller, target|
  target.not_voted_by(controller.current_user.id)
end
```

## Keyword arguments

Scopes with keyword arguments need to be called in a block:

```ruby
# in the model
scope :for_course, lambda { |course_id:| where(course_id: course_id) }

# in the controller
has_scope :for_course do |controller, scope, value|
  scope.for_course(course_id: value)
end
```

## Apply scope on every request

To apply scope on every request set default value and `allow_blank: true`:

```ruby
has_scope :available, default: nil, allow_blank: true, only: :show, unless: :admin?

# model:
scope :available, ->(*) { where(blocked: false) }
```

This will allow usual users to get only available items, but admins will
be able to access blocked items too.
